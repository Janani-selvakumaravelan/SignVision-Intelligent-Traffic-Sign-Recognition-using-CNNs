# SignVision-Intelligent-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNNs
ntelligent Traffic Sign Recognition is a deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. Built and trained in Google Colab, the model recognizes various road signs crucial for autonomous driving applications
