# SignVision-Intelligent-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNNs
ntelligent Traffic Sign Recognition is a deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. Built and trained in Google Colab, the model recognizes various road signs crucial for autonomous driving applications


Libraries Required:
TensorFlow: For constructing and training the deep learning model.
Keras: High-level neural networks API used with TensorFlow.
OpenCV: For image processing tasks like resizing and augmenting the dataset.
Matplotlib: For data visualization (plotting training curves and confusion matrix).
NumPy: For handling numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling CSV files.
